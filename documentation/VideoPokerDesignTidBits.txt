Each Player has a Hand (ONLY ONE HAND)


Deck Class

Either we can make the Hand class complicated with a bunch of if statemeents or a simplify by having specialized hands
Each of the following customized classes inherit from the Five Card Hand class
Royal Flush
Straight Flush
Flush
Full House
Five of a Kind
Four of a Kind
Three of a Kind
Two Pair
One Pair
High Card
Jacks or Better

Key Novel Idea:
We must get a deck of cards and play Poker to make sure we thorougly understand all of the rules.  

We will become Poker experts once this project is completed.


Make sure we keep this Python code implementation very Pythonic
- use list compression
- use maps
- use lists
- use dictionary
- use set
- use lambda

This will greatly simplify the implementation of the video poker game


Call

cards are in two digits
1st digit - encoded card value  or encoded rank
2nd digit - suit

based on rules
same suit  --> Suit Testing
royal flush (1)
straight flush (2)
flush (5)


Card Value --> Rank Testing
Four of a Kind (3)
Full House (4)
Straight (6)
Three of a Kind (7)
Two Pair  (8)
Pair (9)

Unrelated Cards
High Card (10)

How can you test the sequence of cards in hand?

I understand how to test the suit types in a hanc by using the set command.
