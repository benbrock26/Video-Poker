- example credit default datasets

Toyota Job Description

Detailed knowledge of advanced analytics modeling including several of 
Descriptive Analytics 
  - Descriptive analytics (univariate and multivariate statistics or data visualization)

Predictive analytics (supervised learning techniques such as logistic regression or Classification and Regression Trees (CART) or other tree-based techniques; and unsupervised learning models such as cluster analysis).

Time series forecasting techniques.

Prescriptive analytics: optimized decision strategies using methods such as decision tree models, linear programming, stochastic and/or dynamic modeling.



An ability to communicate data-driven insights effectively with management and business stakeholders at their level of expertise and experience.

Knowledge of statistical software such as R, Python (Numpy/Pandas), or SAS.
Proficiency with SQL and data warehouses.

Experience in developing consumer credit scoring models or other credit loss models or strategies using credit reporting data.   Experience implementing credit scorecards or other statistical models in production software. 

- credit data sets


What TFS does
Design, develop, refine and maintain TFS credit default models using statistical software and develop Risk scoring models based on credit bureau attributes and internal data.

Monitor performance of existing risk functionality (scorecards, forecasts, models, and strategies). Identify enhanced functionality and recommend improvements to leverage data science or analytics in credit risk management.

Refresh and use the advanced analytics models driving TFSâ€™s Collections Treatment Optimization program.  Develop and manage forecasts using time series techniques, including ARIMA.
